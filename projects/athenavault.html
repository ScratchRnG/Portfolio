    <div class="argus-note">
      <p>
        As shown above, AthenaVault strictly references only the content of the files you upload.
        In this example, I used one of my class syllabus for demonstration purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, however, I relied on AthenaVault extensively for personal certification study.
        Every note I created was uploaded and later referenced on demand, making it incredibly easy
        to quickly locate specific information and revisit key concepts.
      </p>

      <p>
        This approach proved especially effective for organized studying and accurate note referencing.
