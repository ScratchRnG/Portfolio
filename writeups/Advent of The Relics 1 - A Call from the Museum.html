    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this Sherlock-style investigation, an employee at CALE receives an unexpected email and follows its instructions,
      triggering suspicious activity that causes them to panic and pull the power cable. A month later, the same email becomes
      the starting point for a cyber investigation. The objective is to trace the infection chain starting from the email,
      identify the malicious attachment and indicators, and uncover the command-and-control infrastructure and second-stage delivery.

    <h2>Video Walkthrough</h2>
    <p>
      This write-up is provided as a YouTube walkthrough where I demonstrate the investigative workflow, key pivots, and how each
      artifact leads to the final conclusions.

    <h2>Key Artifacts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Email content and header metadata</li>
      <li>Malicious ZIP attachment delivered via email</li>
      <li>LNK artifact pointing to PowerShell execution</li>
      <li>PowerShell script behavior and outbound network activity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Approach & Techniques Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email & Header Analysis:</strong> validated the suspicious sender versus legitimate mail relay infrastructure and traced delivery paths.</li>
      <li><strong>Attachment & Artifact Review:</strong> identified the ZIP payload and extracted key indicators from its contents.</li>
      <li><strong>LNK & PowerShell Investigation:</strong> analyzed shortcut execution leading to PowerShell-based activity.</li>
      <li><strong>Network & C2 Analysis:</strong> identified outbound POST requests and second-stage infrastructure contacted by the script.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This investigation highlights how a single phishing email can serve as the entry point for a multi-stage attack.
      By combining email triage, artifact analysis, and PowerShell execution tracing, it becomes possible to reconstruct
      the attacker’s activity and identify command-and-control infrastructure. This challenge reinforces the importance
      of strong email analysis skills and disciplined investigation workflows in real-world incident response scenarios.
